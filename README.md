# KDD_DDOS

The Distributed Denial of Service (**DDoS**) attack aims to **exhaust** the computational resources
of a target host (in a computer network) in order to make a service **unavailable**.

The goal of the project "**Synthesis of a KDD Pipeline for DDoS Connections Data Classification**" (**KDD_DDOS**) is to create a KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) pipeline based on supervised **machine learning** algorithm (shallow learning) in order to **classify connections** in the different classes of DDoS attacks. This  algorithm is the **Decision Tree**. The use of this algorithm is motivated by its widespread use in **Technology Transfer** contexts.

The chosen [**dataset**](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ddos-2019.html) derives from a simplification of the one proposed by the **Canadian Institute
for Cybersecurity**.

## Steps of Pipeline

The steps of pipeline are:
1. 
2. Data Exploration: This step is useful to understand 
3. Feature Evaluation:
4. 

And this will produce a flow chart:

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Square Rect] -- Link text --> B((Circle))
A --> C(Round Rect)
B --> D{Rhombus}
C --> D
```


The programming language used is Python (version 3.9.13). The dipendencies are illustrated in "requirements.txt" file.
